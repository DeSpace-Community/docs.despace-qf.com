DeSpace QF - Decentralized Space Quadratic Funding

# Project Description and why it‚Äôs classified as a Public Good

Outer space is _a legally and physically unique domain of human activity_. The DeSpace QF mission is to bring regenerative space exploration by running Quadratic Funding Round Quarterly.

DeSpace QF is a pioneering project aimed at democratizing space exploration through a decentralized approach. The project leverages Quadratic Funding (QF),for equitable allocation of resources based on genuine community interest, enabling broad community support for space exploration initiatives.

It is a public good because it serves the collective interest of humanity in exploring and understanding our universe.

The DeSpace QF is created to support open projects that's directly related to space exploration, and that plays an important role in democratization of space exploration, accepting projects that could be considered public goods. 

In essence, DeSpace QF is not just a funding mechanism, but a catalyst for community-driven space exploration, fostering a culture of collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity. 

However DeSpace QF serves as a Shelling point for all space-related projects, especially if they are interested in web3 technologies.
