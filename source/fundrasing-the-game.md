*Invitation to play the game from Rod Mamin and Paul Bourg*

Let's play The Game? Decentralized Fundraising Game.

The rules are simple:
1. The more money you spend on DeSpace the bigger supporter you are
2. It can be any monetary support: donation to treasury, paying for services,  but now including time or your project services
3. At the end of the round player who decided to play the game get together and issue hypercerts

We started to play the game when payed for DeSpace QF to be listed on [grants.gitcoin.co](https://explorer.publicgoods.network/tx/0x4169d89293c69f5c5b90df0e46079125bde9c3e1b73ce40eb1680238d855b0d0) We payed $500 for that, so lets set the entry price to $250.

The game has already started, so remember:
