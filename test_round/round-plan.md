## Introduction

DeSpace Quadratic Fund goal is to support growing Decentralized Space Exploration projects ecosystem by running Quadratic Funding Rounds quarterly simultaneously with Gitcoin.

Lot of projects that are eligible for DeSpace round are eligible for [Other Gitcoin Grants](https://grants.gitcoin.co/) , hence it's recommended to Grantees to apply for every relevant to their project round.

## Brief

1. DeSpace QF Community fund-raises money for The Fund
2. Money is Distributed among Grantees (DeSpace Projects) using Quadratic Fund
3. To get a portion of the fund Grantees has to raise donations, asking people to vote for project with money
4. Votes shouldn't be bought in any sense. No Quid pro quo
5. Voting happens on-chain using Gitcoin Allo protocol Stack
6. To protect from Sybil Attacks Donors would have get get XX [Gitcoin Passport ](https://passport.gitcoin.co/)score, where XX - TBD
7. The round will be on Arbitrum One chain, with $ETH, $USDC, $ARB accepted for vonations. This chain uses $ETH to pay for gas, so donating in $ETH would require less steps.
8. Donors would have to Bridge their assets into Arbitrum One Chain, using [official Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)  or any other that could work e.g. [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/).
